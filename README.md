Data Source:

The analyzed data, author and publication information (e.g., number of citations, affiliation, titles of publications), were retrieved from Google Scholar web pages by using a web-crawler module in Python, which is named 'scholarly'. Using this package, one can attrieve data by "searching" for name of a specific author, title of a publication, and a keyword that is usually a field of interest. Future analysis will be performed on dataset that is much larger and has more types of information (e.g., details about and collaborators of scholars in various fields) than the existing dataset.
